# Transverse-Project

The search for the presence of water on exoplanets mobilises countless researchers and justifies considerable investment in terrestrial and space instrumentation.
We all have one thing in common, our admiration for astronomy, which has aroused in us a desire to carry out research in order 
to respond to the problem posed in our specifications.
The objective of this project is to determine, through a program in Python language, the habitability zone of different stars 
in order to be able to affirm whether or not an exoplanet orbiting them is likely to have water in liquid form.
